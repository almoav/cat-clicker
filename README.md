# Cat-Clicker
A simple web app for clicking cats.

This is part of the FEWD Nanodegree program at Udacity, using design patterns to build an app from the ground up.

The first commit represents my initial approach to the project specs without understanding the Model View Octopus pattern.

## Project Specs

### Visuals

#### The application should display
* a list of cats by name
* an area to display the selected cat

#### In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
* the cat's name
* a picture of the cat
* text showing the number of clicks
* The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

#### Interaction
* When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
* The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
